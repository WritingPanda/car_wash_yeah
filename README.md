# Car Wash App

## Challenge criteria:

Please build an application for a car wash business. This is an open ended request, so there are many ways you could do this. However, make sure your application can handle the following:
    
- Your car wash accepts cars and trucks.
- You charge $5 for cars.
- Your charge $10 for trucks.
- Your car wash charges $2 extra if the truck has mud in the bed.
- Your car wash does not accept trucks with the bed let down.
- If the vehicle comes in a second time, they get 50% off.
- If the license plate equals 1111111, the vehicle is stolen and does not get a car wash.
 
Please write your code with a mind to its instructional use.

What I'm using:

* [Python 3.6.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-361/)
* [Flask 0.12.2](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [Flask-SQLAlchemy 2.2](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.1/)
* [Flask-Admin 1.5.0](https://flask-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/)
* [Flask-Login 0.3.2](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Flask-Security 1.7.5](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Security/)

## Methodology

For this project, I am going to keep it simple and create a minimally viable product. The goal is to meet the requirements in order to make instruction of building the application as easy to understand as possible. The additions of the other elements in Flask offer opportunities for further expansion of the project, if time, but the main goal is to meet the requirements in as simple of a way as possible.

## Learning Objectives

Since we are working with a microframework, it makes it simpler to breakdown the application into small pieces for people to start using it as soon as they finish the tutorial. Easy to read source code with plenty of comments will help in this regard.

When finished reading the source code or watching the subsequent video (TBD), developers will:

1. Be able to install Flask
2. Write a basic application
3. Understand the fundamentals of Python for web development
4. Utilize a development server
5. Write, read, update, and delete data from a database using Flask-SQLAlchemy
6. Create models to represent their data
7. Understand the use cases for Flask extensions
8. Work from an admin view using Flask-Admin
9. Write a simple user interface using HTML and CSS
10. Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap for styling and organizing the presentation layer
11. Inject data into templates using Jinja2
12. Work with HTML forms and Flask

## Documentation

Oh, it's coming. Just give me a little bit while I write this code here.
